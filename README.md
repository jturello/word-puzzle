# Word Puzzle

####  Epicodus assignment: BDD with Java - Code Review, 2.10.16

#### By James Turello

## Description

This app is a word puzzle game. The user enters some text on the landing page and clicks submit. The text then has all of its vowels replaced with dashes "-" and that encrypted string is displayed on another page where another user can submit guesses as to what the original text was. On an incorrect guess the encrypted string redisplays along with the message the guess did not match and the user can continue submitting guesses. On guessing the correct text the original (and guessed) string displays along with a message that the guess matched.:
